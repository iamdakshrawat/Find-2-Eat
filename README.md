# Find-2-Eat
It is a website which was created by me using HTML and CSS for freshers in my college to find eateries near the campus.
There are 4 files named about.html, contact.html, index.html, localvendors.html which are the html files for the front pages of the website.
There is a CSS folder which has got all the CSS files regarding the 4 front pages.
Then there is a webpages folder which has separate html files for different eateries. These files share a common CSS file whoch is also present in this folder. This folder also have a subfolder which contains the images related to the eateries.
There is a separate Images fodle which contains images of the 4 main pages.
